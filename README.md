# StarWarsGame
I put this together as a fun demo for a group of 4th graders!

To run, install the required packages then navigate to /src and run main.py.

I had some fun playing around with the graphics, like getting the xwings to change orientation for a more smooth look, and adding in the music and sound effects. Learned a lot more about pygame!
